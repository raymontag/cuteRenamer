cuteRenamer v.0.2.3

Written by Karsten König

Description

This is a simple rename-tool with some nice options written in Python with PyQt4.

I started the development because under Mac OS X doesn’t exist a free alternative to “NameMangler” as far as I know. Actually, I work under Linux and alternatives like pyRenamer are in my opinion to overcharged for some simple rename-processes. So here it is: cuteRenamer

Install: The requirements are Python and PySide. 

In the directory where your tarball is extracted type "python setup.py install" with root-rights.

Usage: cuterenamer [options] directory

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --pre=PREFIX          set prefix that will be placed to the left of the
                        number
  --post=POSTFIX        set postfix that will be placed to the right of the
                        number
  -v, --verbose         be chatty
  -s START, --start=START
                        set startnumber
  -l LIST, --list=LIST  use a list of files instead of all files in the
                        directory
  -t, --text-mode       start in text-mode
  -g, --graphical-mode  start in graphical-mode

In graphical-mode:
  Select the directory which includes the files for renaming in the treeview. You can enter a path to a list like
  the -l option in text-mode. The other lines are like the --prefix, --postfix and -s options. 

Plans:
  - Make the GUI more comfortable.
  - Perfectionize the code.
