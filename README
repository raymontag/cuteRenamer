cuteRenamer v.0.3.0

Written by Karsten König

Description

This is a simple rename-tool with some nice options written in Python with PyQt4.

I started the development because under Mac OS X doesn’t exist a free alternative to “NameMangler” as far as I know. Actually, I work under Linux and alternatives like pyRenamer are in my opinion to overcharged for some simple rename-processes. So here it is: cuteRenamer

Install: The requirements are Python and PyQt4. 

In the directory where your tarball is extracted type "python setup.py install" with root-rights.

Usage: cuterenamer

Plans:
  - Make the GUI more comfortable. (This thing with the list is not very smart. I must fix this)
  - Perfectionize the code.
