This is a simple rename-tool with some nice options written in Python with PyQt4.

I started the development because under Mac OS X doesn’t exist a free alternative to 
“NameMangler” as far as I know. Actually, I work under Linux and alternatives like 
pyRenamer are in my opinion to overcharged for some simple rename-processes. So here 
it is: cuteRenamer

This is just a script to start the main program
'''
#!/usr/bin/python

from cuteRenamer.classes import QtGui, MainWindow
from sys import exit

app = QtGui.QApplication(["cuteRenamer"])
    
print "Create the window"
mainWindow = MainWindow()
mainWindow.show()
    
print "Start the application"
exit(app.exec_())
